README: App Sync Zettelkasten

Overview:
This app was built in a single night no sleep, so you can already imagine the level of 
quality I'm also a mediocre programmer, that being said the app serves its purpose well so kudos to me. 

I couldn't find an app that could automatically sync my Obsidian vault across multiple folders, so I decided to create one.

Setup Instructions:
1. Set Up Your Obsidian Vault on Google Drive:
   - Ensure your Obsidian vault is saved in a folder on Google Drive.
   - In the app preferences, paste the path to your Google Drive folder.

2. Set Up Your iCloud Backup Folder:
   - Create a folder on iCloud to store your backups and version-controlled files.
   - Paste the path to this folder in the preferences.

3. Backup Retention:
   - The preferences allow you to specify how many days of backups you want 
     to keep. For example, if you set it to 30 days, the sync script will delete 
     backups older than that.

Special Thanks to:
- Luis: A special shout-out to my friend Luis, who spent the night sleeping 
  behind me while I worked on this. Couldn't have done it without you, buddy!
- The other Luis: He also did nothing but I spammed him with messages about my progress on WhatsApp so he also gets an honorary mention
