# SyncZettelkasten
I couldn't find an app that allowed me to save my Obsidian folder into both Drive and iCloud so I made one.

# When the app launches there's a README, please READHIM.

## Check [releases](https://github.com/Berdasco99/SyncZettelkasten/releases) for .dmg download and detailed steps on installation!
